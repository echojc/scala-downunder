description: "Jan will show how the Reactive Monitor helped a major financial services organisation to provide monitoring of their Akka system. The talk will explore the challenges of monitoring mission-critical systems, especially under heavy load. Jan will show the implementation details of the Reactive Monitor, pointing out the benefits of the Akka IO layer to implement non-blocking and resilient transport layer. The talk will close by going back to the large-scale system and show how we used the information from the monitoring to tune the Akka system.


You will not need any extensive Scala or Akka experience to understand the core principles, though a good appreciation of the challenges of mission-critical systems will help you understand the scale of the problem; knowledge of Akka, Scala and AspectJ will help you understand the details of the code."
