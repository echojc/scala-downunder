description: "One of the fundamental problems of I/O is a core problem of communication: How do I know that the recipient is ready to receive my information?

In a pure push model, without taking into consideration Little's Law, it is very easy to produce data at a faster pace than it can be consumed, leading to loss of information, contention on the medium, or even full system failure.

Reactive Streams provide an asynchronous, concurrent, back-pressured/demand-driven solution for that and other problems. We will discuss this and more in this session."
