description: "This is not about a building a better REST Testing library, it's about DSL design, using REST testing as the example.


Scala is a powerful language and a few intermediate techniques can quickly turned a regular library into a nice literate DSL.


Starting with a fluent API together we will apply these techniques to create a DSL. Showing how they are used and how they compose to form a complete DSL. As the DSL evolves we will examine, what works, what does not and how the DSLâ€™s motivation can inform this.


Finally we examine how to structure and test a DSL codebase; the importance of documentation, noting how DSL documentation is different to library documentation, and discuss when is it appropriate to introduce a DSL."
