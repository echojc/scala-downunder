description: "When an Enterprise Java software product celebrates its decennial, maintenance becomes hard, and new features tend to increase complexity exponentially. Development comes dangerously close to grinding to a halt.


At this point, the team decides to switch to Scala. Without the luxury of green fields, this has to happen incrementally, yet fast.


This talk describes what happens next: How the infrastructure, tools, libraries and architecture change, how the team copes with all this, what lessons are learned and finally, what consequences there are for the product.


The talk is based on the experience of the software development team at imbus with moving to Scala for product development."
