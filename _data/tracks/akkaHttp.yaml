description: "The new akka-http module, the successor of spray.io, provides a fast and fully-featured client- and server-side HTTP stack. It allows you to easily build REST/HTTP-based integration layers for connecting your Scala applications to the world.


In this session we'll look into what akka-http brings to the table, how it is used and where it will add the most value in your overall application architecture.


Plenty of code examples will highlight the various client- and server-side APIs as well as give you an idea for what \"RESTful\" programming with akka-http looks like.


We'll also talk about the improvements it brings over spray and what is on the agenda regarding the transition from Netty to akka-http as the HTTP \"driver\" for the Play framework."
